## Build/Test/Hosting
This website is built using AWS Amplify. The app is hooked up to a CodeCommit repo
hosting this package, and will auto-build on new commits, then deploy somewhere.

## Other Details
This package was created with `create-react-app`, which autogenerated a very useful
`README.md` file. I've included it under the name `create-react-app.README.md`, and
it remains as a useful resource for understanding how build and test work for this
React.js app.

## Shit I Had To Do Manually (In Case It All Burns Down)
* Enable CORS on API Gateway
* Bind Custom Domain Name from Route53 to API Gateway
