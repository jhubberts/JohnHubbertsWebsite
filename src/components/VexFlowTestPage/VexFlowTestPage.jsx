      <p>
        I'm a professional software engineer currently working for Amazon with a variety of experience ranging from
        building and maintaining huge scale distributed systems to working on embedded devices.<br/>
        <br/>
        I set up this website because I like to work on one-off web UI personal projects from time to time, and setting
        up infrastructure is the most boring part, so I figured it would be a good investment of time to figure it out
        once and never have that excuse available again.<br/>
        <br/>

      </p>
    </div>
